Through the app's user profiles, users can share information about their culture, traditions, and interests, fostering cross-cultural understanding and promoting friendships based on shared interests and curiosity about different cultures.

Furthermore, Hacklingo offers language-specific channels and interest-based groups where users can connect with like-minded individuals and engage in conversations on specific topics of interest.
